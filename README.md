# About this Repository
This is a third party Lightpanda docker image building repository.

Images are built based on official [Dockerfile](https://github.com/lightpanda-io/browser/blob/main/Dockerfile)

As the official release currently only offers nightly builds and no stable release version is available, this repository will only generate nightly tags. 

You can visit this Lightpanda docker image at [HERE](https://hub.docker.com/r/wheat0r/lightpanda)

If images were not working normally, please open an issue.
